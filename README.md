# Football Match Simulation
As part of the (MOPSI MOd√©liser Programmer SImuler) course during my second year at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, I worked on a football match simulation project. 
The primary objectives were:
- To simulate football matches in order to be able to determine the most likely end-of-season ranking given the matchs played.
- To create and implement a new indicator: the importance of a match, that is to say how important the outcome of a match is for a team with respect to an end-of-season objective.

Our code was based on different GitHub account of the Dixon-Coles models.
